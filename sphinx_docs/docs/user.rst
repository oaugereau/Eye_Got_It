   Main User Windows

In "User Gestion" (:numref:`main_user_windows`), we can manage the user list by editing them
(select button) or deleting them. We can open the User folder, or add a
new user.

.. _userCreate:

Create User
===========

When you create a new user (:numref:`user_create`), the required data are the first and
last name (because the userâ€™s folder is named with last name and first
name). You can specify extra data like the genre, the Country, The
language level. By default the date select is not displayed. To display
the date selection, just click on "select date" (:numref:`user_create_date`).

.. _userEdit:

Edit User
=========

The User Edit Window (:numref:`user_edit`) is the same as the User Create windows. The
only difference is that the user data are displayed. If the date has
been selected, the date selection is displayed with the date selected
during the creation.
